## Modern Symbolic AI and Automated Reasoning
(*CIS 700* (a Special Topics course) at Syracuse U)

**Note**: parts of this syllabus are subject to change with adequate
notice to students.

The goal of this course is to give students a broad survey of the
research landscape in modern symbolic artificial intelligence and
automated reasoning/deduction. The course will involve three
programming projects and will conclude with a final lecture delivered
by student groups and accompanying set of notes.

## Grading

- 40% -- Programming Projects
- 30% -- Final project presentation and notes
- 20% -- Lead a paper discussion
- 10% -- Participation, Paper Discussion, and Course Notes
- +5% -- Bonus Take-Home Midterm

#### Programming Projects (40%)

Programming projects may be done in groups of up to three. Projects
may be done in any language, though the professor may provide starter
code. Projects will be distributed via the course website.

Projects are due in class two weeks from their assignment date. There
will be reasonable exceptions made in reasonable circumstances (e.g.,
big paper deadline): if you need more time please write me in advance
and articulate when can complete the project, being mindful you cannot
put it of indefinitely.

#### Group Lecture Presentation (30%)

In groups of 3-4 students (three groups for the whole class), you will
study a new topic and you will prepare a lecture. Details on this will
be announced at the end of the course, along with sample topics
recommended by the instructor. Essentially, your group will read
several papers in a state-of-the-art area and will assemble a
presentation. Your presentation must be in the form of a lecture that
spans at least 60 minutes, accounting for questions. You should
include examples, exercises, and discussion--if you would like, you
may assign at most one paper for the class to read and discuss as part
of your lecture--but this paper discussion may not take up more than
30 minutes of your prepared lecture.

In Lieu of a final exam, you will turn a detailed set of notes on your
topic, chronicling the related work you read and proving numerous
examples along with example code.

#### Lead a Paper Discussion (20%)

You **must** lead at least one paper discussion--students are
permitted to do this in pairs if they would like. For this paper
discussion, you must bring slides or well-typed notes which give
several examples that you could walk through, and you are responsible
for ensuring you have enough to say about the paper so that we can
fill a class full, although I will help. You must understand the paper
to the best of your ability. If you do not understand it fully,
dedicate time to reading it and clearly articulate your confusion when
you present it--we will try to clear it up together.

Do not wait to start doing this--presenting is a key part of being a
researcher, and one I want you to practice. I will not grade too
harshly--think of this mostly as participation points, as long as you
put forth good effort and lead a good discussion, I am happy to give
you feedback you can use to improve.

#### Participation, Paper Discussion, and Course Notes (10%)

Each week we will have a Google Groups thread on the week's material
and paper we are reading. You are required to write at least one
substantive response, in the form of either (a) a set of course notes
for the week (in PDF form), providing at least one example (preferably
two or more). Or (b) you may offer a detailed critique and commentary
on a paper.

Essentially: you must make at least one substantive comment on the
class Google Group each week. Be thoughtful and treat this as
professional discourse, rigorously engaging with the ideas of the
course. At the end of the course, I will make all notes public--if you
would prefer I not use your name, please let me know.

I will grade your weekly participation / your comments as follows: 0%,
.5%, or 1%. If you do not participate, I will assign you a 0. If you
participate, but less than I intend to see / your commentary is not
substantive enough, I will give you a .5%. I will give you a 1% if I
think you are making satisfactory and susbtantive engagement with the
course.

#### Bonus Take-Home Midterm (up to +5% bonus)

In mid-October, I (Kris) will be traveling. I will give a bonus
take-home midterm, consisting of detailed questions based on papers
from the class, along with open-ended problems for you to solve. You
can earn at most 5% bonus in the course from this written midterm. I
will be canceling class to allow you to work on the midterm that day.

## Topics

The following is a nonexhaustive list of topics. Topics will follow
papers and may change based on student interest or course direction.

- Classical and intuitionistic propositional logic

- SMT
- DPLL
- CDCL
- Resolution-based theorem proving
- Equality saturation

## Collaboration and the Honor Code

- Please do not cheat in the course.

- Collaboration is explicitly allowed on many assignments, except for
  where otherwise noted. All work that a student represents as their
  own must be completed by the student (with allowed help). Using
  ChatGPT is permissible--if you use it, you must describe how you
  used it and convince me you didn't use it to generate junk.

## Student Support

Syracuse University values diversity and inclusion; we are committed
to a climate of mutual respect and full participation. There may be
aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in
barriers to your inclusion and full participation in this course. I
invite any student to meet with me to discuss strategies and/or
accommodations (academic adjustments) that may be essential to your
success and to collaborate with the Office of Disability Services
(ODS) in this process.

If you would like to discuss disability-accommodations or register
with ODS, please visit their website at
http://disabilityservices.syr.edu. Please call (315) 443-4498 or email
disabilityservices@syr.edu for more detailed information.

ODS is responsible for coordinating disability-related academic
accommodations and will work with the student to develop an access
plan. Since academic accommodations may require early planning and
generally are not provided retroactively, please contact ODS as soon
as possible to begin this process.

## Student Mental Health

Mental health and overall well-being are significant predictors of
academic success. As such it is essential that during your college
experience you develop the skills and resources effectively to
navigate stress, anxiety, depression and other mental health
concerns. Please familiarize yourself with the range of resources the
Barnes Center provides (https://ese.syr.edu/bewell) and seek out
support for mental health concerns as needed. Counseling services are
available 24/7, 365 days a year, at 315.443.8000.
